Below is the **Screenshots** section of the **README.md** for your **InventorySync** project, focusing exclusively on the navigation pages as requested. Since the project‚Äôs frontend (`other.html`) is a single-page application with distinct sections (Dashboard, Data Upload, Data Preview, Visualizations, and Chatbot) accessible via navigation, this section includes screenshots for each of these pages. Each page has two side-by-side images to showcase different aspects of the interface, with brief descriptions for context. The images are properly aligned using Markdown tables for a modern, clean layout. Placeholder image paths are used, as actual screenshots need to be captured from the running application.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup: Create the Scheduled Email Table

Before running InventorySync, you must create the `scheduled_reports` table in your PostgreSQL database.  
**This step is required for the scheduled email/report feature to work.**

### 1. Open your SQL editor (e.g., Neon, pgAdmin, DBeaver, or psql).

### 2. Run the following SQL code to create the table and indexes:

```sql

CREATE TABLE public.scheduled_reports (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    schedule_name varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp WITHOUT TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at timestamp WITHOUT TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    next_run_time timestamp WITHOUT TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    frequency varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    custom_frequency jsonb,
    recipients jsonb NOT NULL,
    subject varchar(200) NOT NULL,
    message text,
    template_id varchar(50),
    active boolean DEFAULT true,
    last_run timestamp WITHOUT TIME ZONE,
    run_count integer DEFAULT 0,
    metadata jsonb,
    start_time timestamp WITHOUT TIME ZONE,
    end_time timestamp WITHOUT TIME ZONE
);

CREATE INDEX idx_scheduled_reports_next_run ON public.scheduled_reports (next_run_time, active);
CREATE INDEX idx_scheduled_reports_user ON public.scheduled_reports (user_id);
